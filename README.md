# Generative-AI-Conversation-to-Input-Text-Blueprint
A Home Assistant blueprint to integrate generative AI into your dashboards. It links an input_text helper for your prompt to any conversation agent (like OpenAI). The automation then captures the AI's response and displays it in a second input_text helper, perfect for creating interactive AI chats and tools in your UI.
